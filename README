Map of Public Buildings in Great Britain 1900s
==============================================

This <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/buildings/index.html">application</a> was designed and built by Cynthia So at UCL DH during a three-week postgraduate placement with the <a href="https://www.nls.uk">National Library of Scotland</a>. The interactive map displays the locations of different public buildings in Great Britain in the 1900s.

The application uses the <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/gb1900">GB1900</a> gazetteer, as well as <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and <a href="https://geoserver.org/">GeoServer</a>.
